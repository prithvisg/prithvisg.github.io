Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://uic.edu/) where I am a part of the [CS Theory Group](https://theory.cs.uic.edu/). My research interests are in Theoretical Computer Science, Graph Theory and its applications in different fields. Currently, I am working on adapting various notions of curvatures from smooth continuous spaces to discrete settings to analyze complex networks. I develope approximation algorithms for these measures. I also apply these shape measures to analyze real world networks with a specific focus on Traumatic Brain Injury networks. I spent the summer of 2022 interning at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) working with the AI Infrastructure team. During my undergrad, I worked on problems in Digital Image Forensics and Image Processing.

Apart from research, I take deep interest in music and reading. I am always looking for new music recommendations. My current favorite genres are: Future Bass, Dubstep, House and Rap. I love reading non-fiction books. Currently, interested in reading about Eastern philosophies. If you have any interesting book suggestion, throw them my way.

If you have any questions about my research or want to collaboarate on anything, feel free to reach out to me via email.
