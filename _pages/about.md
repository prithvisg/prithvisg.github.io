Hello! I'm a Research Scientist at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), based out of New York. Previously, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://uic.edu/) where I was a part of the [CS Theory Group](https://cstheory.lab.uic.edu/home). During my PhD, I worked on problems in the intersection of Theoretical Computer Science, Graph Theory and Computational Biology. My research focused on adapting concepts of curvature from smooth continuous spaces to finite metric spaces, such as Graphs and Hypergraphs, to better understand complex networks. I also applied these shape measures to analyze real-world networks, like metabolic Networks and social Networks. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on problems in Digital Image Forensics and Image Processing.

Outside of research, I'm passionate about music and reading. I'm always on the lookout for new music recommendations — my current favorite genres include Future Bass, Dubstep, House, and Rap. I also love reading non-fiction books, so if you have an interesting recommendation, throw it my way!

If you have any questions about my research or want to collaboarate on anything, feel free to reach out to me via email.
