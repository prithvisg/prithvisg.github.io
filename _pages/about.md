Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://uic.edu/) where I am a part of the [CS Theory Group](https://theory.cs.uic.edu/). My research interests are in Theoretical Computer Science, Graph Theory and its applications in real-world networks like Biological Systems and Brain Networks. Previously, I have worked on Digital Image Forensics.
